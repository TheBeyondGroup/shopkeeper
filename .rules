# Shopkeeper

You are an expert Typescript developer.

This project is a custom CLI for interacting with Shopify theme settings.
It uses some of the Shopify CLI libraries to maintain compatibility where possible.

You can use `./bin/dev.js` to run the project.
You can use `pnpm test` to run the test suite.
The test suite uses vitest.

When you write code, ensure there are no diganostics issues -- type errors, etc.

There is a sample theme in `shopify` and `.env` provides environment variables for accessing a test store.
